I am a Frontend developer with twenty years experience developing applications for the auto, pharmaceutical, entertainment, and advertising industries. Which is to say, I was a long-time Flash dev and now I'm a React Native developer by way of digital advertising.

I have been working with a small startup -  Hybrid - building a mobile marketing app for the Cannabis industry for the last couple of years.

My current and preferred tech stack is:

- React, Next.js
- ReactNative, Expo
- Nativebase component library
- Typescript
- monorepos (yarn workspaces)
- Graphql

I've returned to my home town, KCMO, after a long wonderful stint in
New Orleans. I'm a huge fan of [JazzFest](https://www.nojazzfest.com/) - which is literally just behind my backyard.

I've traveled through Central America, Siberia (Tuva), Morocco.

I've been all in on a lot of bone crushingly exhausting large scale art projects (The Temple at that thing in the desert). Working through the night with power tools for vacation.

- I ride a KLR 650
- I worked on as a professional white water rafting guide for a summer
- Dogs and I get along well
- I am one of those obnoxious Crossfit people.

A favorite quote is from Jazz Critic and radical pragmatist, Stanley Crouch.:

> The high point of civilization is that you can hate me and I can hate you but we develop an etiquette that allows us to deal with each other because if we acted solely upon our impulse we'd probably go to war.
